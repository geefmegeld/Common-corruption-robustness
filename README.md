# Common-corruption-robustness

Code repository for my internship project: Improving robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks against Common Corruptions in images.

# Usage

The jupyter notebooks are in the folder "Model training" which has been split into the AugMix code and the code witht the Fourier transform. Each folder contains two notebooks: one with CIFAR-10 code and the other with CIFAR-100 code.

# Requirements

In the "requirements.txt" are noted which packages with the corresponding version are used for the experiments. Some of these are redundant and not used for the experiments.
